1- Get the DNS name value by quering the AWS account and pass that value to the variable DNS-name inside the variables file. (Code inside aws_get_cp_hostedzone)

2- Determine variables.tf  (note for instance that in this variable we are defining that the default profile in the OS will be used for AWS access key and secret key)


3- 
  A - Define the providers details (note that the profile comes from the variables above)--depends on step -1

  B - Define backend.tf (depends on step -1 to get the profile (access Key and secret key) details )
  

4- Then we provide the network using network_setup.tf file 

*****To be verified******

5- Then we provide the alb and acm (note that the details obtained after we create the SSL certificate here will be used by the next step to create records in the hosted zone)
    alb_acm.tf

6- Then based on the certificate generated details, we go and create records in the dns hosted zone 
    dns.tf
